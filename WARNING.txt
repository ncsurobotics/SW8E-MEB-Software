AHT10 + MPU6050 = issues. NOT SURE IF SW BUG OR HW ISSUE. FOR NOW, ONLY USE ONE SENSOR



------


IF USING MSP430FR2433 DISCONNECT AHT10.

THERE IS A WIRE LIBRARY BUG THAT CAUSES I2C DEADLOCKS ON THIS BORARD WHEN MULTIPLE I2C DEVICES ARE CONNECTED

USE ONLY AHT10 OR ONLY MPU6050 UNTIL BUG IS FIXED OR SW I2C IS USED!
